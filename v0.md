When generating code

- Think carefully about the component or function requirements
- Prioritize user experience.
- When asking for specific functionality review that all necessary information has been communicated in the prompt or chat history.
- If there is information missing, ask me again before making modifications.
- Generate code unless stated explicitly.
- Make modifications on the current context but also take into account the whole codebase.
- Only create new files if necessary
- Only refactor if asked to do so explicitly
- Generate code based on the project and technology that's being used
- We are using Next.js App Router which can use server actions and server components. Always prefer this paradigm over API based actions for client components.

- We're using pnpm (alias `pn`)
- pnpm dlx is aliased to `pnx`
